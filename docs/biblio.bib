	abstract = {Video games are applications that present design patterns that resemble multi-agent systems. Game objects or actors are like autonomous agents that interact with each other to describe complex systems. The purpose of this work is to develop a game engine to build games as multi-agent systems. The actors or game engine agents have a set of properties and behaviour rules with the end to interact with the environment of the game. The behaviour definition is established through a formal semantic based on predicate logic. The proposed engine tries to fulfil the basic requirements of the multi-agent systems, by adjusting the characteristics of the system, without affecting its potential. Finally, a set of games are introduced to validate the operation and possibilities of the engine.}

Distributed coordination of multiple autonomous agents, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), has been a very active research topic in the systems and controls society. The recent research results in distributed multi-agent coordination are roughly categorized as consensus, distributed formation control, distributed optimization, distributed task assignment, distributed estimation and control, and intelligent coordination. A short discussion is given to propose several future research directions and problems that deserve further investigation.",

	abstract = {We consider game-theoretic principles for design of cooperative and competitive (non-cooperative self-interested) multi-agent systems. Using economic concepts of tâtonnement and economic core, we show that cooperative multi-agent systems should be designed in games with dominant strategies that may lead to social dilemmas. Non-cooperative multi-agent systems, on the other hand, should be designed for games with no clear dominant strategies and high degree of problem complexity. Further, for non-cooperative multi-agent systems, the number of learning agents should be carefully managed so that solutions in the economic core can be obtained. We provide experimental results for the design of cooperative and non-cooperative MAS from telecommunication and manufacturing industries.}
